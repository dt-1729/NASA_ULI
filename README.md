# Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM)
 Cloud-based aggregator 
Possibly distributed (sector-wise) or centralized
Determine the path for each UAS – to schedule how many and where the vehicles go
 Relay perceived and evolving information to individual vehicles – redetermine/correct the paths
…

UAS
 Heterogenous, multi-speed
Provide its own parameters (e.g. start and destination points, fuel, make, travel parameters (desired ETA, etc.) to the aggregator
Report path conditions to the aggregator
 Provide Control parameters to track path/time  dictated by aggregator

Sectors characterized by a sequence of intersections and Air-Corridors 
Intersections 
Multi-input multi-output
Flexible locations and geometry
Each input-output will be multi-lane and bidirectional
Accommodate different types of vehicles (e.g. speed wise)
 Air-Corridors 
Bidirectional and multi-lane
Flexible locations and geometry
Different UAV speeds  (hovering or holding patterns) are possible

Model input and output parameters for these constructs

Ground Resources
Can be mobile or static landing stations
